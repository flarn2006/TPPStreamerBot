# TPPStreamerBot
This is the source code for [/u/TPPStreamerBot](http://reddit.com/u/TPPStreamerBot), the bot that posts streamer messages to the TPP live updater. I'm posting the source code here because maybe some people may find it useful for something, or someone may just be curious how it works. Also because there's really just no reason not to.

This is actually not the original version of the bot, but it's the only one in use now. I recently re-wrote it in Python so it would be compatible with Linux, and as a result the code is much more streamlined as well.
